			<h3>About</h3>
			<p class="p-about">Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Evan Moon and I am a front-end web developer located in Las Vegas, Nevada. I'll be graduating from DeVry University, Oxnard in April 2015, <i>summa cum laude</i>, with a B.S. in Web Development & Administration.</p> 

			<p class="p-about">From a young age, my love of working with computers blossomed into a passion for creating dynamic and responsive websites that are both beautiful, and interactive. As a child, I would spend hours reading HTML books and practice writing out code by hand on notebook paper! I love problem solving and seeing my careful planning and design manifest into something I am truly proud of. My greatest strengths are my natural curiosity and perfectionist attitude, as I strive every day to improve my skills and learn something new. I always hold myself and my work to the highest standard which motivates me to challenge myself and seek new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.</p> 

			<p class="p-about">What I love about web development is that it is a perpetual learning experience that brings new dynamic challenges to the table each and every day. Whether it's learning a new framework or programming language, working in a team environment and collaborating with colleagues, or tackling solo projects and going from analysis and design, to development and implementation -- I really love what I do and can't imagine doing anything else for a career!</p>
